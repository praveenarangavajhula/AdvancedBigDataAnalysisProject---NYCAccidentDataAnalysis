##Analyzing NYC Accident Data Using Spark

In this project, we are looking to analyze a dataset provided by the New York Police Dept. The dataset details information of motor vehicle collisions in New York City and consists of around 800,000 rows. We will aim to draw interesting conclusions and make meaningful predictions based on this data. As of now, we are going to make the following analysis from the data set:
Analyzing accident locations by borough layered with time
Evaluating the type of accident with different times of the day
Determining the major cause of accidents which led to deaths
Analyzing the types of vehicles which were involved in accidents and 
Figuring out the most frequent accident locations
Predicting whether an accident can lead to death based on the details of the accident such as vehicle, time and location.

Technologies:
We intend to use the Python packages for Spark, Spark SQL and MLib for Big Data Analysis in the back-end. MLib will be used for the prediction part whereas Spark and Spark SQL will be used for the data analysis. 
For the data visualization aspect of the project, we will be using amcharts and D3.js

Data Sources:
We will be working with a data set from NYC Open Data:
